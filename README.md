# Environment for TSPL course  
I personally recommend using it with vscode and its remote-container plugin.  
Image size could be a bit large (~3GB).   
To build and run:
`docker run -it $(docker build -q .)`
- [ ] TODO: upload it to dockerhub.
- [ ] TODO: using multi-stage building to save some disk space.
